## Terra API                                        <!-- prefix: TAPI -->
- **Status:** Active — Docker orchestration infrastructure built 2026-07-26. All services running
  locally: Backend (8081/8082), Postgres (5433), Redis (6379), Jenkins (8090). TAPI-012 (CI/CD)
  and Phase 5 (Redis+Postgres) both live-verified on EC2 as of 2026-07-20.
- **Active Task:** Docker environment setup (2026-07-26): root docker-compose.yml created at
  parent level; docker-compose.dev.yml updated with Docker-aware JDBC/Redis overrides
  (postgres:5432 DNS, container networking). terra-api-fe Dockerfile written (multi-stage React).
  All three sibling repos (terra-api, terra-api-fe, terra-jenkins) now have versioned compose
  configs. Commits pushed to origin/bitbucket.
- **Next Step:** Complete terra-api-fe npm install; uncomment frontend service in
  docker-compose.dev.yml; verify full stack docker build. Then integrate FE into Jenkins pipeline
  (TFE-101/102/103 phase-1-auth-shell branch work).
- **Blockers:** None — local dev fully operational.
- **Context:** Docker architecture: parent folder (non-repo) references child docker-compose files
  per service. docker.env at parent level contains shared secrets + Docker-aware overrides. Jenkins
  webhook auto-trigger still unresolved (manual "Scan Now" required; SCM polling vs public tunnel
  TBD). terra-api-key.pem gitignore decision pending. Pre-PR branch convention (2026-07-20) still
  active for all merges.

## terra-api-fe                                     <!-- prefix: TFE -->
- **Status:** Active — scaffolded 2026-07-24, Dockerfile written 2026-07-26 (multi-stage React build)
- **Active Task:** TFE-001 — Docker build integration (completed 2026-07-26): Dockerfile created
  (builder + runtime stages, serve on 3000). npm install pending locally before docker build works.
  Pushed Dockerfile commit to origin/main (`efe1cb1`).
- **Next Step:** Complete `npm install` in terra-api-fe root; uncomment frontend service in
  docker-compose.dev.yml; verify full stack builds. Then work TFE-101/102/103 on `phase-1-auth-shell`
  — login flow + JWT storage/attach against terra-api endpoints.
- **Blockers:** npm dependencies not yet installed locally (docker build will fail until resolved)
- **Context:** CRA (React 19, plain JS — no TypeScript), `main` branch. Dual-remote: `origin`
  (GitHub) + `bitbucket`. Sibling to terra-api + terra-jenkins under terra-api-home. Dockerfile
  pushed 2026-07-26; awaiting local npm install to complete docker build cycle.

## ROMS                                             <!-- prefix: ROMS -->
- **Status:** Deployed but static — not being redeployed until actually needed (Will's call,
  reconfirmed 2026-07-22; first made 2026-07-07). Effectively maintenance mode in practice, though
  not officially declared as such.
- **Active Task:** ROMS-001 — first real integration target for Terra API shared services, once live
- **Next Step:** Blocked on Will's decision to actually redeploy ROMS — TAPI-001 (JWT auth) makes the
  eventual integration technically unblocked, but there's no live target to integrate against yet.
  Don't scope integration details further until that trigger fires.
- **Blockers:** ROMS not redeployed — deliberate, no timeline
- **Context:** Spring Boot + React. First potential revenue source, once actually integrated.

## PIOS                                             <!-- prefix: PIOS -->
- **Status:** Design phase — no coding until ADR-013 resolves
- **Active Task:** PIOS-001 — resolve ADR-013 (event schema versioning)
- **Next Step:** Draft ADR-013 options + tradeoffs
- **Blockers:** ADR-013 is the gating decision; ADRs 012–014 pending
- **Context:** Event-sourced. FastAPI/Python reserved. Rules-engine-gated AI signals.

## terra-hq-site                                    <!-- prefix: THQ -->
- **Status:** Active — parallel track
- **Active Task:** THQ-002 (Visualizer health-tier coloring) opened 2026-07-17, Planned/notes-only.
- **Next Step:** Implement color model (HEALTHY/YELLOW/ORANGE/RED tiers from Terra API
  `ecosystem-health` endpoint) to replace binary connected/disconnected. Open design question:
  per-cube polling vs. single Terra API ecosystem-health endpoint poll.
- **Blockers:** None
- **Context:** 2026-07-18 session completed: (1) Clarified dual-visualizer architecture (terra-hq-site
  public + terra-api-fe scoped both read from Terra API ecosystem-health endpoint — single source
  of truth); (2) Refactored terra_api_strategy.html (removed 430 lines embedded WebGL, added
  domain-prefixed ADRs terra-api-adr-001–010, linked to build phases); (3) Fixed product pages
  (ROMS/PIOS using domain-prefixed ADRs roms-adr-001–005, pios-adr-011–015); (4) Cleaned up Notion
  CI/CD pages (renamed ADR-009→terra-api-adr-010, updated status/references). All changes staged for
  commit. CLAUDE.md, TASKS.md, terra_api_strategy.html modified locally; ready to commit.

## DSA Practice                                     <!-- prefix: DSA -->
- **Status:** Active — recurring
- **Active Task:** DSA-001 — Arrays (start of progression)
- **Next Step:** First Arrays problem via 3-phase methodology
- **Blockers:** None
- **Context:** Java default. Arrays → Strings → Linked Lists → Trees → Graphs → DP.

## Cross-Project Notes                              <!-- no prefix — ecosystem-wide, not project-scoped -->
- **SonarQube gate (noted 2026-07-18):** Ecosystem-wide code-quality pass planned across all
  projects, once, before full deployment — not a per-project or per-PR blocker. Intent: keep
  developing/adding functionality now, run it later, likely wired into the CI/CD pipeline being
  built under Terra API's TAPI-012. No task ID yet — too early to scope.
- **"Launch and forget" production-hardening goal (noted 2026-07-20):** End-state goal across
  every deployed service — running reliably without needing to babysit it (Will's own framing:
  "like a site like apple"). Already in place per-service via TAPI-012's pattern: container
  `restart: unless-stopped`, CI/CD auto-deploy on merge, `/actuator/health`-style endpoints.
  Genuinely missing, ecosystem-wide, none built yet: (1) monitoring/alerting — nothing currently
  notifies if a service goes down, has to be noticed manually; (2) automated database backups;
  (3) OS-level security patching automation; (4) domain names + TLS (everything is raw
  IP:port right now — ROMS included, which has had zero domain since its own 2026-05-04 deploy).
  Deliberately not being built now — same "don't build ahead of the actual need" pattern as
  everything else here. No task ID yet.

## claude-skills                                    <!-- prefix: SKILLS -->
- **Status:** Active — hub v1.1 complete, pointers placed, both open decisions resolved
- **Active Task:** SKILLS-006 — dogfood: run `load hub tapi` in a fresh Claude Code session
- **Next Step:** Open a real Claude Code session in terra-api, confirm the CLAUDE.md pointer
  auto-activates the hub, verify orientation line, log any friction
- **Blockers:** None
- **Context:** Hub v1.1 committed and pushed 2026-07-09 (first round); second round of fixes
  (CLAUDE.md pointers, `sync skills`→`sync hub` rename, session-context-sync excluded from
  Notion flow, TAPI/ADR-003 correction) applied on disk, not yet committed. Git = sole source of
  truth for ai-control; Notion = informational dupe only.

## Yahoo Mail MCP Server                            <!-- prefix: YMCP -->
- **Status:** Active — OAuth persistence fix deployed 2026-07-26, live-verified via Render deploy logs
- **Active Task:** YMCP-002 — reconnect Yahoo Mail MCP connector once in Claude to pick up token under new signing scheme
- **Next Step:** After reconnect, confirm token holds across a natural idle/spin-down period without forcing re-auth
- **Blockers:** None
- **Context:** Repo `willtchouente/yahoo-mail-mcp-server` (fork of `jtokib/yahoo-mail-mcp-server`),
  deployed on Render free tier. Session 1 (2026-06-22, YMCP-001) fixed IMAP-layer instability
  (connection pooling, retry-with-backoff, SSE heartbeat) — necessary but not sufficient, since
  reconnect complaints persisted. Session 2 (2026-07-26) found the actual root cause: OAuth
  `validTokens`/`authCodes` were in-memory Set/Map, wiped every Render spin-down (~15min idle +
  ephemeral filesystem). Fixed by making tokens stateless (HMAC-signed via Node `crypto`, no
  jsonwebtoken dep, 30-day TTL via `ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`). Added `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`
  (10min health ping) as secondary defense against spin-down itself. Full history in repo's own
  `DEV_LOG.md` (Phase 1 + Phase 2). Notion: PAI subproject page `📨 Yahoo Mail MCP Server`.
